What is Normalization
Database normalization is the process of organizing data to minimize data redundancy
(data duplication), which in turn ensures data consistency.
Database normalization is a step by step process. These are 6 normal forms, First
Normal form (1NF) thru Sixth Normal Form (6NF). Most databases are in third Normal
Form (3NF). There are certain rules, that each normal form should follow.

/*
First Normal Form (1NF)
A table is said to be in 1NF, if
1.	The data in each column should be atomic. No multiple values, separated by comma.
2.	The table does not contain any repeating column groups
3.	Identify each record uniquely using primary key.
